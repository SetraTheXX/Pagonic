## 👋 Hello, I'm Setra!

I'm **19 years old** and developing Pagonic alone. This project started when I realized that WinRAR was insufficient in meeting the needs of modern times.

### 💭 Why Pagonic?

While using WinRAR, I constantly faced these issues:
- 🐌 **Slow performance** - Minutes of waiting for large files
- 🎨 **Old interface** - Design from the 90s
- 💰 **License issues** - Constant reminders
- 🤖 **Not intelligent** - No optimization based on file type
- 🔒 **Closed source** - We don't know what it does

To solve these problems, I developed Pagonic by working day and night for **4.5+ months**.

---

## 🚀 Final Words

The reason I started Pagonic was actually very simple: I wanted **a better compression program on my own computer**. I didn't start with a big goal like challenging WinRAR, I just wanted to make something more modern, faster for my own needs.

As a **19-year-old developer**, this journey wasn't easy. I wrote code for nights, optimized algorithms, wrote tests. Over time, the project really progressed a lot and now it has reached a nice point with **100% test success**, **300+ MB/s performance**, **AI-powered smart system**.

**I hope** I can offer the community a **good alternative**. This started as just a personal project, but maybe it can help others too.
